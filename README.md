# Find the GCD of two numbers

## AIM:
To write a program to find the GCD of two numbers using function.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
## Step 1:
Define a function.
## Step 2:
Get the two numbers from the user.
## Step 3:
Compare the two values, to find the smaller number.
## Step 4:
Use for() and if() loop to find the GCD of the two numbers.

## Program:
```

def gcd():
    a=int(input())
    b=int(input())
    while b!=0: 
        a,b=b,a%b
    print("GCD of two numbers is:",a)  
```
  

## Output:
